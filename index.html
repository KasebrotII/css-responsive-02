                    <h2>Fawcett Comics</h2>
                    <p>One of the most successful comic book publisher in the 1940's, Fawcett Publications
                    began in 1919 with the magazine, <cite>Captain Billy's Whiz Bang</cite>. Its total
                    circulation from all of its publications eventually reached over 10 million issues
                    a month.</p>
                    <p>Fawcett is best known for its popular superhero, Captain Marvel, based on the
                    adventures of radio reporter Billy Batson who would turn into Captain Marvel
                    upon uttering the word <em>Shazam!</em>. Other successful characters include
                    Ibis the Invincible, Hopalong Cassidy, and Mister Scarlet. Fawcett was also known
                    for its series of horror comics including <cite>Beware! Terror Tales</cite>,
                    <cite>Worlds of Fear</cite>, and <cite>Strange Suspense Stories</cite>. The
                    company branched out into humor comic magazines with <cite>Otis and Babs</cite>
                    and <cite>Hoppy the Marvel Bunny</cite> among its most popular titles.</p>
                    <p>Facing declining sales, Fawcett Comics ceased publication of its superhero
                 titles in 1953. Several of its titles were eventually sold to Charlton
                 Comics.</p>
